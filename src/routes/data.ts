Extra points to the Third and Seventh houses, places where you're likely to find very talented flesh magicians; five points to the other houses as flesh magic is quite generally used, and if not, there's a whole articulating hand in there for the bone magicians. The Ninth House don't rate this quite as highly as the sack of ossicles because you have to get the flesh off first. The Eighth House does not want your sack of fresh human hands.</p>\n<p>The Second House gets an extra point because we could always eat those hands. We've eaten worse.</p>",

The Seventh House scores a cool five points off this one because it would be a very Seventh House thought to be found dead and draped in the Cohort flag. Symbolic... aesthetic.... Raw</p>",

The Fifth House also may well reach for this, but it's to write down everyone on the boat's memoirs, and perhaps a group letter expressing regret at what a bish they've made of it and perhaps a small measure of buttoned-up, restrained feeling for their lovers back home. </p>\n<p>The Seventh House have written a single, very beautiful and oblique sentence about the water. The Eighth House have written down a list of any moral crimes committed on the boat.</p>",
