If it was a more useful bone or even a fresher bone, sure, or let's say a whole skeleton, that would be arguably useful, but in the hands of most bone adepts the ossicle is simply an ossicle. You're from the Ninth House if you ranked this highly, which means odds are good that you are 90+ and have kidney and bladder problems.",

Fresh flesh (say that five times fast) will carry a goodly amount of thanergy (death energy) <em>and</em> thalergy (life energy), which in the hands of a necromancer might be put to good purpose. Extra points to the Third and Seventh houses, places where you're likely to find very talented flesh magicians; five points to the other houses as flesh magic is quite generally used, and if not, there's a whole articulating hand in there for the bone magicians. The Ninth House don't rate this quite as highly as the sack of ossicles because you have to get the flesh off first. The Eighth House does not want your sack of fresh human hands.\nThe Second House gets an extra point because we could always eat those hands. We've eaten worse.",

The only reason you get +1 from any other House is because you could maybe use it as shade. The Seventh House scores a cool five points off this one because it would be a very Seventh House thought to be found dead and draped in the Cohort flag. Symbolic... aesthetic.... Raw",

The Fifth House also may well reach for this, but it's to write down everyone on the boat's memoirs, and perhaps a group letter expressing regret at what a bish they've made of it and perhaps a small measure of buttoned-up, restrained feeling for their lovers back home. \nThe Seventh House have written a single, very beautiful and oblique sentence about the water. The Eighth House have written down a list of any moral crimes committed on the boat.",
